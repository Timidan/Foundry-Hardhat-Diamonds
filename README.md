# Foundry + Hardhat Diamonds

This is a mimimal template for [Diamonds](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2535) which allows facet selectors to be generated on the go in solidity tests!

## Installation

- Clone this repo
- Install dependencies

```bash
$ yarn && forge update
```

### Compile

```bash
$ npx hardhat compile
```

## Deployment

### Hardhat

```bash
$ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

### Foundry

```bash
$ forge t
```

`Note`: A lot of improvements are still needed so contributions are welcome!!

Bonus: The [DiamondLoupefacet](contracts/facets/DiamondLoupeFacet.sol) uses an updated [LibDiamond](contracts/libraries//LibDiamond.sol) which utilises solidity custom errors to make debugging easier especially when upgrading diamonds. Take it for a spin!!

### Verify

This addition to the template allows you to verify your contracts on deployment. 
An example `.env: .env.example` and hardhat config `example.hardhat.config.js` has been provided
To verify, you need to include your etherscan API included.
